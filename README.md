![canvas](https://github.com/xssrae/Red-Team-Notes/blob/main/IMG/canvas.png)

This is like my *"second brain"*. Here i have all the Obsidian notes for my day work as a Red Team. Some notes haven't been ended for many reasons but should be cool to see updates to this repository.

Feel free to use and consult them if you want.
